# Start.Tool

Start.tool is a quick and easy way to initialise your node repository. If you are like me then you want to avoid having to type:

```
node install
node start
```

every time you want to run or initialise your node application.

This is a simple script file which will do all the hard work for you.

## Apple troubles

Sadly, unless you manage to compile this script into a `.app`, you will have to initialise the script file before you can use it. This is documented inside the script file itself. Simply type the following command in terminal:

```
chmod u+x <path of your command file>.command
```

From now on you should be able to copy and paste the file wherever you wish to use it.
